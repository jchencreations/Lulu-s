# Lulu-s
3D VR cooking game developed at CMU National High School Game Academy in 2024 in 2 weeks

Welcome to Lulu's...You've been captured by Cthulu's curse and forced to cook for him at his creepy restaurant in the ocean, Lulu's. It's a challenge to keep yourself sane while you satisfy the customer's orders, all the while making sure to poison some of them based on Cthulhu's requirements. Have fun...
